    "Human activity recognition using smartphones dataset and an LSTM RNN. Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:\n",
    "- WALKING,\n",
    "- WALKING_UPSTAIRS,\n",

    "Compared to a classical approach, using a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) require no or almost no feature engineering. Data can be fed directly into the neural network who acts like a black box, modeling the problem correctly. Other research on the activity recognition dataset used mostly use a big amount of feature engineering, which is rather a signal processing approach combined with classical data science techniques. The approach here is rather very simple in terms of how much did the data was preprocessed. \n",

    "## Details about input data\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using an LSTM on the data to learn (as a cellphone attached on the waist) to recognise the type of activity that the user is doing. The dataset's description goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I will use the almost raw data: only the gravity effect has been filtered out of the accelerometer  as a preprocessing step for another 3D feature as an input to help learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an RNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in [this article](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), an RNN takes many input vectors to process them and output other vectors. It can be roughly pictured like in the image below, imagining each rectangle has a vectorial depth and other special hidden quirks in the image below. **In our case, the \"many to one\" architecture is used**: we accept time series of feature vectors (one vector per time step) to convert them to a probability vector at the output for classification. Note that a \"one to one\" architecture would be a standard feedforward neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://karpathy.github.io/assets/rnn/diags.jpeg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "An LSTM is an improved RNN. It is more complex, but easier to train, avoiding what is called the vanishing gradient problem. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Outstandingly, **the final accuracy is of 91%**! And it can peak to values such as 92.73%, at some moments of luck during the training, depending on how the neural network's weights got initialized at the start of the training, randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the neural networks is almost always able to correctly identify the movement type! Remember, the phone is attached on the waist and each series to classify has just a 128 sample window of two internal sensors (a.k.a. 2.56 seconds at 50 FPS), so those predictions are extremely accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I specially did not expect such good results for guessing between \"SITTING\" and \"STANDING\". Those are seemingly almost the same thing from the point of view of a device placed at waist level according to how the dataset was gathered. Thought, it is still possible to see a little cluster on the matrix between those classes, which drifts away from the identity. This is great.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to see that there was a slight difficulty in doing the difference between \"WALKING\", \"WALKING_UPSTAIRS\" and \"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS\". Obviously, those activities are quite similar in terms of movements. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also tried my code without the gyroscope, using only the two 3D accelerometer's features (and not changing the training hyperparameters), and got an accuracy of 87%. In general, gyroscopes consumes more power than accelerometers, so it is preferable to turn them off. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "In [another open-source repository of mine](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/HAR-stacked-residual-bidir-LSTMs), the accuracy is pushed up to 94% using a special deep LSTM architecture which combines the concepts of bidirectional RNNs, residual connections and stacked cells. This architecture is also tested on another similar activity dataset. It resembles to the architecture used in \"[Google’s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144.pdf)\" without an attention mechanism and with just the encoder part - still as a \"many to one\" architecture which is adapted to the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about deep learning, I have also built a list of the learning ressources for deep learning which have revealed to be the most useful to me [here](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/awesome-deep-learning-resources). You could as well learn to [learn to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04474.pdf) (not for the faint of heart). Ok, I pushed the joke deep enough... \n",
